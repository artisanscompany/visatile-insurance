## Ship, Validate, Refine

- Merge "prototype quality" code to validate with real usage before cleanup
- Features evolve through iterations (tenanting: 3 attempts before settling)
- Don't polish prematurely - real-world usage reveals what matters
- PR [#335](https://github.com/basecamp/fizzy/pull/335) merged as "prototype quality" to validate design first

## Fix Root Causes, Not Symptoms

**Bad**: Add retry logic for race conditions
**Good**: Use `enqueue_after_transaction_commit` to prevent the race ([#1664](https://github.com/basecamp/fizzy/pull/1664))

**Bad**: Work around CSRF issues on cached pages
**Good**: Don't HTTP cache pages with forms ([#1607](https://github.com/basecamp/fizzy/pull/1607))

## Vanilla Rails Over Abstractions

- Thin controllers calling rich domain models
- No service objects unless truly justified
- Direct ActiveRecord is fine: `@card.comments.create!(params)`
- When services exist, they're just POROs: `Signup.new(email:).create_identity`

## Frontend Architecture: Inertia.js + React

We use **Inertia.js with React** for frontend development, deviating from 37signals' Hotwire approach.

### Why Inertia + React

- **Rich interactivity** - Complex dashboard UIs benefit from React's component model
- **Type safety** - TypeScript catches errors at compile time
- **Modern tooling** - Vite, React DevTools, component libraries
- **No API layer** - Rails controllers render directly to React (like ERB)
- **Server-side routing** - Rails routes remain the source of truth

### Key Principle: Server Controls Navigation

```ruby
# Rails controller
render inertia: "Discovery/Show", props: {
  workstation: serialize_workstation(@workstation)
}
```

```tsx
// React component receives props directly
export default function Show({ workstation }: Props) {
  return <WorkstationDetail workstation={workstation} />
}
```

### Component Library: shadcn/ui

We use shadcn/ui for UI components because:
- Components are copy-pasted (not npm dependency)
- Built on Radix UI (accessible, headless)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Full control over component code

### What We Avoid

- Client-side routing (React Router, etc.)
- State management libraries (Redux, Zustand)
- API endpoints for page data (GraphQL, REST APIs for SPA)
- Separate frontend deployments

See [Inertia.js + React](inertia-react.md) for complete patterns.

## DHH's Review Patterns

See [dhh.md](dhh.md) for comprehensive review patterns extracted from 100+ PR reviews.

Key themes:
- Questions indirection: "Is this abstraction earning its keep?"
- Pushes for directness - collapsed 6 notifier subclasses into 2 ([#425](https://github.com/basecamp/fizzy/pull/425))
- Prefers explicit over clever (define methods directly vs introspection)
- Removes "anemic" code that adds layers without value
- Write-time operations over read-time computations
- Database constraints over AR validations

## Common Review Themes

- **Naming**: Use positive names (`active` not `not_deleted`, `unpopped`)
- **DB over AR**: Prefer database constraints over ActiveRecord validations
- **Migrations**: Use SQL, avoid model references that break future runs
- **Simplify**: Links over JavaScript when browser affordances suffice ([#138](https://github.com/basecamp/fizzy/pull/138))

## When to Extract

- Start in controller, extract when it gets messy
- Filter logic: controller → model concern → dedicated PORO ([#115](https://github.com/basecamp/fizzy/pull/115), [#116](https://github.com/basecamp/fizzy/pull/116))
- Don't extract prematurely - wait for pain
- Rule of three: duplicate twice before abstracting

## Rails 7.1+ `params.expect` ([#120](https://github.com/basecamp/fizzy/pull/120))

Replace `params.require(:key).permit(...)` with `params.expect(key: [...])`:
- Returns 400 (Bad Request) instead of 500 for bad params
- Cleaner, more explicit syntax

```ruby
# Before
params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email)

# After
params.expect(user: [:name, :email])
```

## StringInquirer for Action Predicates ([#425](https://github.com/basecamp/fizzy/pull/425))

Instead of string comparisons, use StringInquirer:

```ruby
# Bad
if event.action == "completed"

# Good
if event.action.completed?

# Implementation
def action
  self[:action].inquiry
end
```

## Caching Constraints Inform Architecture ([#119](https://github.com/basecamp/fizzy/pull/119))

Design caching early - it reveals architectural issues:
- Can't use `Current.user` in cached partials
- Solution: Push user-specific logic to React components reading from shared props
- Leave FIXME comments when you discover caching conflicts

## Write-Time vs Read-Time Operations ([#108](https://github.com/basecamp/fizzy/pull/108))

All manipulation should happen when you save, not when you present:
- Use delegated types for heterogeneous collections needing pagination
- Pre-compute roll-ups at write time
- Use `dependent: :delete_all` when no callbacks needed
- Use counter caches instead of manual counting

See [dhh.md](dhh.md#write-time-vs-read-time-operations) for detailed examples.

## Jason Zimdars: Design & Product Patterns

See [jason-zimdars.md](jason-zimdars.md) for comprehensive patterns from [@jzimdars](https://github.com/jzimdars) (Lead Designer at 37signals).

Key themes:
- **Perceived Performance > Technical Performance** - If it *feels* slow, it's slow
- **Prototype Quality Shipping** - "Ship to validate" is a valid standard
- **Production Truth** - Real data reveals what local testing can't
- **Extend Don't Replace** - Branch with parameters, keep old paths working
- **Visual Coherence** - Ship visual redesigns wholesale, not piecemeal
- **Feedback as Vision** - Share UX concerns, let implementers figure out how

## Jorge Manrubia: Architecture & Rails Patterns

See [jorge-manrubia.md](jorge-manrubia.md) for comprehensive patterns from [@jorgemanrubia](https://github.com/jorgemanrubia) (Programmer at 37signals).

Key themes:
- **Narrow Public APIs** - Only expose what's actually used
- **Domain Names Over Technical** - `depleted?` not `over_limit?`
- **Objects Emerge from Coupling** - Shared params → extract object
- **Memoize Hot Paths** - Methods called during rendering
- **Layer Caching** - HTTP, templates, queries at different granularities
- **Fixed-Point for Money** - Integers, not floats (microcents)
- **VCR for External APIs** - Fast, deterministic tests

## Rails Patterns

### Delegated Types for Polymorphism ([#124](https://github.com/basecamp/fizzy/pull/124))

Use `delegated_type` instead of traditional polymorphic associations:

```ruby
class Message < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :bubble, touch: true
  delegated_type :messageable, types: %w[Comment EventSummary],
                 inverse_of: :message, dependent: :destroy
end

module Messageable
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern
  included do
    has_one :message, as: :messageable, touch: true
  end
end
```

**Why**: Automatic convenience methods (`message.comment?`, `message.comment`) without manual type checking.

### Store Accessor for JSON Columns ([#113](https://github.com/basecamp/fizzy/pull/113))

Use `store_accessor` for structured JSON storage:

```ruby
class Bucket::View < ApplicationRecord
  store_accessor :filters, :order_by, :status, :assignee_ids, :tag_ids

  validates :order_by, inclusion: { in: ORDERS.keys, allow_nil: true }
end
```

**Why**: Type casting, validation, and cleaner API (`view.order_by` vs `view.filters['order_by']`).

### Normalizes for Data Consistency ([#1083](https://github.com/basecamp/fizzy/pull/1083))

Use `normalizes` to clean data before validation (Rails 7.1+):

```ruby
class Webhook < ApplicationRecord
  serialize :subscribed_actions, type: Array, coder: JSON

  normalizes :subscribed_actions,
    with: ->(value) { Array.wrap(value).map(&:to_s).uniq & PERMITTED_ACTIONS }
end
```

**Why**: Ensures data consistency before validation, no `before_validation` callbacks needed.

### Concern Organization by Responsibility ([#124](https://github.com/basecamp/fizzy/pull/124))

Split models into focused concerns:

```ruby
class Bubble < ApplicationRecord
  include Assignable      # Assignment logic
  include Boostable       # Boost counting
  include Eventable       # Event tracking
  include Poppable        # Archive logic
  include Searchable      # Full-text search
  include Staged          # Workflow stage logic
  include Taggable        # Tag associations
end
```

**Guidelines**:
- Each concern should be 50-150 lines
- Must be cohesive (related functionality together)
- Don't create concerns just to reduce file size

### Scopes Named for Business Concepts ([#124](https://github.com/basecamp/fizzy/pull/124))

```ruby
# Good - business-focused
scope :active, -> { where.missing(:pop) }
scope :unassigned, -> { where.missing(:assignments) }

# Not - SQL-ish
scope :without_pop, -> { ... }
scope :no_assignments, -> { ... }
```

### Transaction Wrapping ([#124](https://github.com/basecamp/fizzy/pull/124))

Wrap related updates for consistency:

```ruby
def toggle_stage(stage)
  transaction do
    update! stage: new_stage
    track_event event, stage_id: stage.id
  end
end
```

**When to use**: Multi-step operations, parent + children records, state transitions.

### Touch Chains for Cache Invalidation ([#124](https://github.com/basecamp/fizzy/pull/124))

```ruby
class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  has_one :message, as: :messageable, touch: true
end

class Message < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :bubble, touch: true
end
```

Changes propagate up: comment → message → bubble, invalidating caches automatically.
