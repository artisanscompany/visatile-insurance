           There are odds no one is taking. The markets that are too risky, founders that are too unproven, sectors that are too regulated, niches that are not hot enough, monopolies that are too strong to beat, regions with capital too scarce.

            So, while billions flow to the same cities, the same founder archetype, the same ideas, the same GPT wrappers, the same thesis and opportunites, many problems sit unsolved and opportunities untapped beacuse the odds are too low. </p>

          We don't confuse odds with outcomes, because odds are a measure of consensus, not potential. The defining outcomes, markets, companies, and solutions, almost always started as crazy bets some lunatics made.

            If you are that type of lunatic, we'd love to hear from you. If you're building something impactful and hard that no one will touch, you've found your people. If you invest in what others won't, let's talk. If you want to work on impossible things that actually matter, we're here.
