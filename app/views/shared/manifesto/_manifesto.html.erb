            Everyone loves talking about the underserved. Very few actually build for or fund them. The markets are too risky, the founders are unproven, the returns are uncertain, the niche is not hot enough, the monopolies are too strong, capital is too scarce etc.

            Billions flow to the same cities, the same founder archetype, the same ideas, the same GPT wrappers, the same thesis. Meanwhile, many problems sit unsolved, not because they're unsolvable, but because they are underserved.

            We know the odds and don't think they're a reason to stop. The problems we care about won't solve themselves, and the markets we serve can't afford to wait for the smart money to show up.

            If that sounds like your kind of energy, we'd love to hear from you. If you're building something hard and you're tired of being told no, you've found your people. If you invest in what others won't, let's talk. If you want to work on things that actually matter, we're here.
